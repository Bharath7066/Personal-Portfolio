# Personal-Portfolio

I built a personal portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean, user-friendly design. Focused on UI/UX best practices, it adapts beautifully across mobiles, tablets, and desktops. Each section highlights my skills, projects, and experience with smooth navigation, responsive layouts, and interactive elementsâ€”designed to create a lasting impression on any device.
